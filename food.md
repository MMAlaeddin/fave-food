# My Favorite Foods!
I am a happy and heavy eater!  I experiment in my own kitchen and love going to restaurants too!  I am _very_ diverse with my food choices and enjoy cuisine from all over the world.  Here you will get a chance to read about **TOP THREE FAVORITE FOODS** and some fun facts about them. Here goes: 
### Pho Tai
* Origins of Pho go back to Vietnam. 
* There are two versions of pho, northern and southern:
  1. Northern Pho is more robust and has a bit more flavor and heartiness
  2. Southern Pho is much lighter with softness to its broth which makes it wonderful for a cold winter evening.
* I've tried pho in 28 different states and countless cities! 
### Nihari
* The food from my motherland, Pakistan!
* Nihari is a thicker gravy type sauce with beef shank and traditionally made with cow brain sprinkled on top.  However, in the states it's hard to find with brain. 
* Nihari can be eaten with bread or rice, I prefer rice!
### Barbacoa Tacos
* Barbacoa originated in the Caribbean but is well known to be a staple of Mexico
* It's traditionally made with lamb but you can find a lot of beef versions as well which are great! 
Simply tender shredded juicy meat!
